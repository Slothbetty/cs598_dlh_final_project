# Final Project for CS598 DL4H in Spring 2022

This repository is a reproduction of the "Automated ICD-9-CM medical coding of diabetic patient‚Äôs clinical reports" paper which was published in 2018[[1]](#1). We used the public MIMIC III dataset[[2]](#2) and reproduced the three parellel convolutional layers' CNN model, CNN baseline models and Bag of Tricks models to obtain the simliar result as the paper did.

‚óè	Citation to the original paper(done)
‚óè	Link to the original paper‚Äôs repo (if applicable)(no repo)
‚óè	Dependencies
‚óè	Data download instruction
‚óè	Preprocessing code + command (if applicable)
‚óè	Training code + command (if applicable)
‚óè	Evaluation code + command (if applicable)
‚óè	Pretrained model (if applicable)
‚óè	Table of results (no need to include additional experiments, but main reproducibility result should be included)

## Dependencies

Following are the dependencies we applied in our code, which could be easily installed by run all in the google colab:
```Setup
!pip install -U strsimpy
!pip install simplejson
```

## Data download instruction

Following are the data download instruction for our project:
1. Apply the access to MIMIC-III Clinical Database V1.4 through this link. https://eicu-crd.mit.edu/gettingstarted/access/
2. Register account for MIMIC-III Clinical Database V1.4 and upload the corresponding certificate document.
3. Access the Clinical Database through Google Bigquery and execute the query in dataset_generation.sql there. Export the query running result as a csv file and save it. This csv file is the raw data that we are going to use in our project.

## Training

To train the model(s) in the paper, run this command:

```train
python train.py --input-data <path_to_data> --alpha 10 --beta 20
```

>üìã  Describe how to train the models, with example commands on how to train the models in your paper, including the full training procedure and appropriate hyperparameters.
## Evaluation

To evaluate my model on ImageNet, run:

```eval
python eval.py --model-file mymodel.pth --benchmark imagenet
```

>üìã  Describe how to evaluate the trained models on benchmarks reported in the paper, give commands that produce the results (section below).
## Pre-trained Models

You can download pretrained models here:

- [My awesome model](https://drive.google.com/mymodel.pth) trained on ImageNet using parameters x,y,z. 

>üìã  Give a link to where/how the pretrained models can be downloaded and how they were trained (if applicable).  Alternatively you can have an additional column in your results table with a link to the models.
## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on :

### [Image Classification on ImageNet](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet)

| Model name         | Top 1 Accuracy  | Top 5 Accuracy |
| ------------------ |---------------- | -------------- |
| My awesome model   |     85%         |      95%       |

>üìã  Include a table of results from your paper, and link back to the leaderboard for clarity and context. If your main result is a figure, include that figure and link to the command or notebook to reproduce it.
